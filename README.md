# Console-Finances
Introduction to JavaScript

## Description
This is my first challenge of JavaScript where financial data is reviewed and calculated to draw conclusions. This information is viewed on the *console*. 


## Deployed information
This console can be accessed using this link:

Please note: Use the Chrome Browser and then F12/right click and click on 'Inspect to access the console. 




A screenshot of what the portfolio would look like, once deployed, is below:
